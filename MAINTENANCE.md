# Alchemy maintenance plan

Status: **planning / pre-feature**
Scope: restore a reproducible, headless-verifiable build and stabilise the repo so
feature work can resume. No feature or behaviour changes land on this branch.

Branch: `chore/revive-build-and-ci` (from `master` @ `1a4ac99`)

---

## Baseline (verified 2026, OpenJDK 25.0.4.1, Fedora 44 x86_64)

Verified facts this plan is built on:

- All 91 source files (~25.6k LOC) **compile clean on JDK 25** with only
  deprecation/unchecked notes:

  ```sh
  CP=$(find lib -name '*.jar' | grep -v ant/ | tr '\n' ':')
  find src -name '*.java' > /tmp/srcs.txt
  javac -encoding ISO-8859-1 -cp "$CP" -d /tmp/alcbuild @/tmp/srcs.txt   # 0 errors
  ```

- The shipped `releases/Alchemy-008.tar.gz` **still runs on JDK 25**: 25 JPF plugins
  register and start, canvas renders (checked under Xvfb). Runtime is healthy.
- `nbproject/project.properties` sets `javac.source/target=1.5`, which modern `javac`
  rejects outright: `error: Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 8 or later.`
- A plain `javac` build cannot run the app: module archives (`modules/*.zip`) are only
  produced by the NetBeans/Ant pipeline, so launch aborts with
  *"At least one module must be installed for Alchemy to run."*
- No tests, no CI, no `.gitignore`. `releases/` = 182 MB of committed binaries,
  `.git` = 204 MB.

Conclusion: **the source is fine, the build is dead.** Workstream 1 is the blocker for
everything else.

## Workstream 1 - build + CI (blocking)

Goal: `git clone && <one command>` produces a runnable Alchemy with loadable modules,
and CI proves it on every push.

- [ ] Decide toolchain: **Gradle (recommended)** vs a standalone Ant script that drops
      the NetBeans `nbproject/build-impl.xml` import, `ant-contrib` and `jarbundler`.
- [ ] Raise `source`/`target` from `1.5` to `8` first (minimum churn), then evaluate `17`.
- [ ] Replace the custom `jpf-zip` Ant task with an equivalent packaging step so
      `modules/*.zip` are produced from `src/` + `modules/*/plugin.xml`.
- [ ] Keep `modules/` and `lib/` next to the launchable jar (runtime assumption), and
      make the launchable task set the working directory accordingly — plugin discovery
      uses the cwd-relative `new File("modules")` in `AlcPlugins`.
- [ ] Move replaceable deps to Maven Central: Batik, MigLayout, commons-logging,
      XMLCommons/`xml-apis`. Keep vendored: JPF 1.5.1, JPen (+ natives), Quaqua, Foxtrot.
- [ ] Evaluate `lib/itext.jar` (unlabelled vintage) against OpenPDF before touching
      PDF export; PDF export is a user-visible feature, do not change behaviour here.
- [ ] Delete the developer-local leftover in `nbproject/project.properties`:
      `file.reference.foxtrot.jar-1=../../../../Sony/Exhibition Workshop/...`
- [ ] Add a `run` task and a `smokeTest` task that boots the app under Xvfb and fails on
      any exception on stderr (the current manual proof method).
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions matrix: ubuntu / macos / windows x JDK 17 / 21 / 25,
      jobs = compile + smoke launch. No deploy.
- [ ] Keep NetBeans project files working (or state explicitly in README that they are
      retired) - do not leave a half-supported second build path.

**Acceptance:** a clean clone builds and boots on a machine with only a JDK installed;
CI green on Linux/macOS/Windows.

## Workstream 2 - module SDK + first tests

Goal: writing and verifying a module does not require NetBeans, a 4.6 MB template zip
or a human staring at a window.

- [ ] Publish the module API from source (`src/org/alchemy/core`) instead of trusting the
      committed, stale `javadocs/` HTML tree; decide whether `javadocs/` stays in git.
- [ ] Turn `templates/AlchemyModuleTemplate-008.zip` into a buildable module archetype
      that inherits Workstream 1's build.
- [ ] Document the module contract (lifecycle `setup/cleared/reselect/deselect/commited`,
      input callbacks) in `modules/README.md` with a "build and run in 3 commands" section.
- [ ] Add a headless test harness: drive `AlcCanvas` with synthetic mouse/pen events and
      assert on shape counts and pixel diffs of the rendered canvas.
- [ ] Add regression tests for the known-bad paths recorded as TODOs:
      `affect/ShapeSwap` ("General Path is not Serialised"), `affect/Blindness`
      ("autoreveal bug"), `create/PullShapes` ("Bug test this"),
      `core/AlcMenuBar` (vector clipboard copy unimplemented),
      `core/AlcCanvas` (scaleable image export unimplemented).
- [ ] Inventory the `static` state on `AlcModule` (`canvas`, `toolBar`, `math`,
      `window`, `colorSelector`, `bundle`) and record in writing what a module may and
      may not touch. Do not refactor it in this branch.

**Acceptance:** `./gradlew test` runs a module end-to-end with no display and no clicks.

## Workstream 3 - repo and platform hygiene

Goal: cheap, low-risk cleanups. Split into independently reviewable commits; the history
rewrite is a separate, announced branch because it changes every SHA.

- [ ] `chore/drop-binaries-from-history` (**separate branch, needs sign-off**): move
      `releases/` to GitHub Releases and `git filter-repo` the history (204 MB -> ~20 MB).
      Coordinate with anyone holding forks; force-push required.
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` (`build/`, `dist/`, `nbproject/private/`, `*.class`) and
      `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`, `*.jar binary`).
- [ ] Normalise source to UTF-8 + LF and fix mojibake: the macOS key hints in
      `core/Alchemy.java` are literal `"?"` where `Command`/`Shift`/`Option` glyphs
      belong (`KEY_MODIFIER_STRING`, `KEY_SHIFT_STRING`, `KEY_ALT_STRING`). Also drop
      `source.encoding=ISO-8859-1`; audit the 4 files with high bytes
      (`AlcColorSelector`, `AlcToolBar`, `OSXAdapter`, `create/SplatterShapes`).
- [ ] Fix Linux file open in `core/AlcUtil`: `gnome-open` / `kde-open` no longer exist;
      use `java.awt.Desktop` or `xdg-open`, and drain/`waitFor` the spawned process.
- [ ] Remove or re-source `core/AlcNative` (`System.loadLibrary("AlcNative")` for a
      binary and source that are not in this repo); its only callers are the macOS
      menu-bar toggles in `core/AlcWindow`.
- [ ] Retire the dead macOS paths: `core/OSXAdapter` and the `com.apple.eawt` /
      `com.apple.eio.FileManager` reflection do nothing on modern macOS.
- [ ] Replace fire-and-forget error handling (43 `printStackTrace`, 41 `catch (Exception)`)
      with logged, user-visible failures; remove `System.exit(0)` from plugin loading in
      favour of a real startup error path. Start with the startup/plugin/canvas paths only.
- [ ] Update README: correct the "requires JRE 1.5 or above" claim, state the JDK actually
      supported, and describe the new build commands.

**Acceptance:** Linux file-open works on a current desktop; no mojibake in any UI string;
startup failures report what went wrong.

## Explicitly out of scope for this branch

- Undo/select/edit or any canvas behaviour change.
- Refactoring the large core classes (`AlcCanvas` 2000, `AlcToolBar` 1592,
  `AlcColourIO` 1216, `AlcPreferences` 1135, `AlcUtil` 1099, `AlcMenuBar` 984 LOC).
- Migrating off Swing/Java2D or off JPF.
- New modules or new export formats.

## Open questions

1. Is this a personal fork for one contributor, or should the revival be coordinated
   upstream (force-push and history rewrite affect every existing fork)?
2. Which JDK do we commit to supporting, and does macOS/Quaqua support still matter
   (Quaqua is the oldest-looking dependency in `lib/`)?
3. Is the JPen pen-tablet path still a requirement? It is the main reason natives ship
   in `lib/jpen`, and it is the least likely thing to survive a platform update.
